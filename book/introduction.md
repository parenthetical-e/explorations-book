# Introduction

This is a book about the problem of exploration in biology, as a whole. This is a small and incomplete book. It does not try to be exhaustive. It does not try to paint every detailed line of the problem. Rather, think of it as a fast sketch. I want to explain the problem's highlights, and different ways to solve them. The focus is on computaional and mathmatical accounts, in particular. This is an explorable book as well. Most the main ideas are presented as 'living' cells of python code that can be run, and more importantly altered. 

Feel free to play around. 

# Motivation

I wrote this book because I couldn't find a book about exploration that spans scientific fields. The problem, or as well see the problems of exploration, cross fields so there should be a book that does as well. In other words, I wanted to.
