# Oh, my dilemma

In this chapter we will talk about exploration to maximize reward, where missed opportunities do matter. Another way to say this is exporation for reward, with regret.

Unlike other exploration problems we have face, this one has not optimal solution, and is intractable. It leads to a Dilemma.... 

This doesn't mean we can't get part of the way to a solution.
